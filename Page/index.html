            <p class="paragraph fact-para">
              After completing their education under Guru Sandipani Muni,
              Krishna and Balarama asked their Guru what he wanted as Guru
              Dakshina ( fee for imparting knowledge). Guru Sandipani Muni asked
              them to restore his dead son who had disappeared in an ocean near
              Prabhasa. Balaram and Krishna travelled to the spot where they
              learnt that their Guru's son had been trapped by a demon who lived
              inside a conch named Panchajanya which they subsequently took to
              Yama (God of Death) and asked him to restore the boy. Thus,
              Krishna and Balarama succeeded in restoring their Guru's son.

            <p class="paragraph fact-para">
              Krishna died due to the culmination of many curses. As legend
              goes, Gandhari's curse on Krishna was that he would die with the
              entirety of his clan in 36 years. Krishna was cursed a second time
              by the sage Durvasa, when he was asked by him to apply kheer all
              over his body. Krishna obeyed but did not apply kheer on Durvasa's
              feet as they were resting on the ground. Enraged, Durvasa cursed
              Krishna saying that his death would be by his foot.
